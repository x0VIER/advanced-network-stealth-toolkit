# Contributing to Advanced Network Stealth Toolkit

We welcome contributions from security researchers, developers, and privacy advocates to enhance the **Advanced Network Stealth Toolkit**. Your expertise can help us build a more comprehensive and robust resource for understanding and mitigating network stealth techniques.

Please take a moment to review this document before submitting your contributions.

## Ethical Use Policy

**All contributions MUST adhere to the ethical use policy outlined in the main `README.md` file.** This toolkit is strictly for educational, research, and legitimate security testing purposes. Contributions that promote or facilitate illegal activities, unauthorized access, or malicious use will not be accepted.

## How to Contribute

We are looking for contributions in the following areas:

*   **New Modules/Techniques:** Develop new tools or examples for network evasion, covert channels, stealthy reconnaissance, or secure communication.
*   **Improve Existing Content:** Enhance existing modules by adding new features, optimizing performance, improving error handling, or refactoring code for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Documentation:** Improve existing documentation, add new examples, create tutorials, or contribute to a glossary of terms related to network stealth and privacy.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Address any issues or bugs identified in the code or documentation.
*   **Testing:** Add or improve unit and integration tests for existing or new modules.

**General Guidelines for Contributions:**

*   **Ethical Focus:** Ensure your contributions align with the ethical use disclaimer. Clearly state the intended legitimate use case for any new tool or technique.
*   **Modularity and Clarity:** Design your tools to be modular, focused on a single responsibility, and easily understandable. Provide clear explanations of the underlying principles.
*   **High-Quality Code:** Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines. Write clean, readable, and well-commented code. Prioritize efficiency and robustness.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every new tool or significant change should be accompanied by clear docstrings, inline comments, and a dedicated `README.md` within its module subdirectory, explaining its purpose, usage, and examples.
*   **Test Coverage:** New features and bug fixes should ideally come with corresponding unit tests to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
*   **Beginner-Friendly Examples:** Provide simple, practical examples that demonstrate how to use the tool effectively and safely.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain the existing structure, formatting, and coding standards of the Toolkit.

### Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/advanced-network-stealth-toolkit.git
    cd advanced-network-stealth-toolkit
    ```

3.  **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/add-timing-covert-channel` or `fix/packet-padding-bug`):

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/add-new-stealth-module
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your new module, improvement, or bug fix. Ensure your code adheres to the guidelines mentioned above.

5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message. Use a conventional commit style if possible (e.g., `feat: Implement new timing covert channel`):

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add [Description of your contribution]"
    ```

6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin feat/add-new-stealth-module
    ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the original `advanced-network-stealth-toolkit` repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a new pull request from your recently pushed branch. Fill out the pull request template with relevant information, explaining your changes and why they should be included.

## Review Process

All pull requests will undergo a thorough review by the maintainers. We will pay close attention to the ethical implications of the proposed changes. We may suggest improvements to the code, documentation, or design to ensure the highest quality and consistency across the Toolkit. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main project, and you will be credited for your valuable work.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Advanced Network Stealth Toolkit**! Your efforts help strengthen network security and privacy awareness.
