## Modules & Techniques

### Traffic Obfuscation & Evasion

This section focuses on methods to make network traffic less detectable or identifiable. It includes techniques like:

*   **Packet Padding:** Adding irrelevant data to packets to obscure their true size or content patterns.
*   **Protocol Manipulation:** Altering standard protocol fields to evade basic intrusion detection systems.
*   **Encrypted Tunnels:** Utilizing various encryption methods to encapsulate and hide traffic within legitimate-looking flows.

### Covert Channels

Explore the creation and detection of covert channels, which allow for hidden communication within legitimate network traffic. Examples include:

*   **Storage Covert Channels:** Hiding data within unused fields of network protocols (e.g., TCP sequence numbers, IP ID fields).
*   **Timing Covert Channels:** Modulating the timing of legitimate network events to encode and transmit hidden information.

### Network Footprinting & Reconnaissance (Stealthy)

Tools and methodologies for gathering information about a target network while minimizing detection. This includes:

*   **Passive Reconnaissance:** Techniques that do not directly interact with the target, such as OSINT and analyzing public records.
*   **Active Reconnaissance with Low Footprint:** Using tools and methods that are designed to be less noisy and more difficult to detect than standard scanning tools.

### Secure Communication & Anonymity

Utilities and examples demonstrating how to establish secure and anonymous communication channels:

*   **VPN Implementations:** Understanding and configuring various VPN protocols for secure tunneling.
*   **Tor Integration:** Examples of routing traffic through the Tor network for enhanced anonymity.
*   **Proxy Chains:** Setting up and utilizing multiple proxies to obscure the origin of network traffic.
